Buddhist Chinese Works Revivified
=================================

  This repository contains my hobby project learning to typeset
  Buddhist Chinese works into a modern-ish format with LuaTeX/LuaTeXja
  using XSLT, XQuery and Lua.

  Note that this project is work in progress and is at an early stage.
  It is a great way for me to procrastinate actually learning
  Classical Chinese.
  
  Texts are sourced from CBETA 漢文大藏經
  (<http://tripitaka.cbeta.org/>).
